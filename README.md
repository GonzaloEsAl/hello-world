# hello-world
My first repo, let's go!
*About me*
-I'm a computer science student in Mexico City, trying to learn how to be a better programmer and improve what I've learnt.
-I love developing ideas, especially when those have a result.
-I love gaming. [^1]



[^1]: Although I love gaming, I tend to use consoles only.
